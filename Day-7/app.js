// Variable and function hoisting

/*
    HOISTING => Memory allocated for a function ::
    Web browser is the compiler for JavaScript
    HLL -> Assembly Language -> Machine level language
    Steps: 
        1. Compiler reads the source code file [Input - Processing - Output]. File is filtered of variables, and memory in allocated accordingly.
        2. Clear the memory allocated after the code is executed.

/* 
    Hoisting move the variables and function declarations to the top of their scope before code is executed.

    No matter where the function is declared it is hoisted to the top of the code file.
